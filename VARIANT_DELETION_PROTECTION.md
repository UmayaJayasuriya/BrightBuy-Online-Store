# Variant Deletion Protection Feature

## Overview

This feature prevents admins from deleting product variants that are part of existing customer orders. This ensures data integrity and preserves order history for record-keeping purposes.

**Implementation Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Active and Tested

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**Problem**: Deleting a variant that is referenced in existing orders would:

- Break order history
- Cause referential integrity issues
- Lose important sales and inventory data
- Create confusion for customers checking past orders

**Solution**: Implement a database trigger that prevents deletion of variants that exist in the `order_item` table.

---

## 🔧 Implementation

### 1. Database Trigger

**File**: `backend/database/triggers/variant_delete_trigger.sql`

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_variant_delete_if_in_order
BEFORE DELETE ON variant
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM order_item
        WHERE variant_id = OLD.variant_id
    ) THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Cannot delete variant: This variant is part of existing orders and cannot be removed.';
    END IF;
END
```

**How it works**:

- Fires **BEFORE** any DELETE operation on the `variant` table
- Checks if the variant exists in the `order_item` table
- If found, raises an error (SQLSTATE 45000) preventing the deletion
- If not found, allows the deletion to proceed

### 2. Backend API Enhancement

**File**: `backend/app/routes/admin.py`

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /admin/variants/{variant_id}`

**Enhanced Error Handling**:

```python
try:
    # Pre-check before trigger
    cursor.execute(
        "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM order_item WHERE variant_id = %s",
        (variant_id,)
    )
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    if result and result['count'] > 0:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail="Cannot delete this variant: This variant is part of existing orders..."
        )

    # Attempt deletion (trigger will also check)
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM variant WHERE variant_id = %s", (variant_id,))

except mysql.connector.Error as e:
    if e.errno == 1644:  # Trigger SIGNAL error
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail="Cannot delete this variant: This variant is part of existing orders..."
        )
```

**Features**:

- ✅ Pre-check before trigger for faster response
- ✅ Handles trigger error (errno 1644)
- ✅ Handles foreign key constraint error (errno 1451)
- ✅ Returns user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Proper transaction rollback on error

### 3. Frontend User Experience

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Single.jsx`

**Enhanced Error Display**:

```javascript
catch (err) {
  const errorMessage = err.response?.data?.detail || 'Failed to delete variant.';

  if (errorMessage.includes('existing orders') ||
      errorMessage.includes('part of existing orders')) {
    alert(
      `⚠️ Cannot Delete Variant\n\n` +
      `The variant "${selectedVariant.variant_name}" cannot be deleted because ` +
      `it is part of existing customer orders.\n\n` +
      `Reason: Orders must be preserved for record-keeping and customer history.\n\n` +
      `Suggestion: You can mark this variant as out of stock instead of deleting it.`
    );
  } else {
    alert(`Error: ${errorMessage}`);
  }
}
```

**Features**:

- ✅ Detects order-related deletion errors
- ✅ Shows clear, informative error message
- ✅ Explains why deletion is blocked
- ✅ Provides alternative solution (mark as out of stock)

---

## 📊 Test Results

**Test File**: `backend/database/test_variant_delete_trigger.py`

**Test Execution Results**:

```
✅ Found variant in orders (Variant ID: 1, "iPhine 17 Pro")
✅ Deletion prevented by trigger
✅ Correct error message displayed
✅ Found variant NOT in orders (Variant ID: 2, "iPhone 17 Pro Max")
✅ This variant CAN be deleted
✅ Trigger exists in database and is active
```

**Test Coverage**:

1. ✅ Variants in orders cannot be deleted
2. ✅ Variants NOT in orders can be deleted
3. ✅ Trigger error message is correct
4. ✅ Trigger exists and is properly configured

---

## 🎬 User Flow

### Scenario 1: Trying to Delete a Variant in Orders

1. Admin navigates to product page (e.g., `Phone1`)
2. Admin selects a variant that has been ordered (e.g., "testphone1")
3. Admin clicks **"Delete Variant"** button
4. Confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure you want to delete...?"
5. Admin confirms deletion
6. **Backend checks** if variant is in `order_item` table
7. **Backend finds** variant in existing orders
8. **Backend returns** 400 error with message
9. **Frontend displays** user-friendly alert:

   ```
   ⚠️ Cannot Delete Variant

   The variant "testphone1" cannot be deleted because it is
   part of existing customer orders.

   Reason: Orders must be preserved for record-keeping and
   customer history.

   Suggestion: You can mark this variant as out of stock
   instead of deleting it.
   ```

10. Variant remains in database ✅

### Scenario 2: Deleting a Variant NOT in Orders

1. Admin navigates to product page
2. Admin selects a variant that has never been ordered
3. Admin clicks **"Delete Variant"** button
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. Admin confirms deletion
6. **Backend checks** if variant is in `order_item` table
7. **Backend finds** no orders with this variant
8. **Trigger allows** deletion to proceed
9. Variant is successfully deleted ✅
10. **Frontend displays** success message
11. Product page refreshes to show remaining variants

## 🔍 Database Schema

### Relevant Tables

**variant**:

```sql
variant_id (PK)
variant_name
SKU
price
stock_available
product_id (FK)
```

**order_item**:

```sql
order_item_id (PK)
order_id (FK)
variant_id (FK) → variant.variant_id
quantity
price
```

**Relationship**:

- One variant can be in **many** order_items (1:N)
- If any order_item references a variant, that variant **cannot be deleted**

## 💡 Alternative Solutions for Admins

If an admin needs to "remove" a variant that's in orders, they can:

1. **Set Stock to 0**: Mark the variant as out of stock

   - Variant remains in database for order history
   - Customers cannot purchase it
   - Still visible in past orders

2. **Hide from Frontend**: Add a "hidden" or "discontinued" flag

   - Variant not shown in product listings
   - Still accessible for order queries
   - Maintains referential integrity

3. **Create New Version**: Create a new variant and discontinue the old one
   - Old variant stays for historical orders
   - New variant used for new orders
   - Clear product evolution tracking

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Trigger Not Working

**Check if trigger exists**:

```sql
SELECT TRIGGER_NAME, EVENT_MANIPULATION, EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE
FROM information_schema.TRIGGERS
WHERE TRIGGER_SCHEMA = 'brightbuy'
AND TRIGGER_NAME = 'prevent_variant_delete_if_in_order';
```

**Recreate trigger**:

```bash
cd backend
python database/apply_variant_delete_trigger.py
```

### Error Not Showing in Frontend

**Check backend response**:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8020/admin/variants/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Expected**: Should return 400 error with detail message
