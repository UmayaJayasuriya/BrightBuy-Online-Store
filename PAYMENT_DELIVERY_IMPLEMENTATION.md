# Payment and Delivery Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete!

### Database Tables Created

#### 1. **payment** table

- `payment_id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)
- `order_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY â†’ orders.order_id)
- `payment_method` (VARCHAR(50)) - 'card' or 'cod'
- `payment_status` (VARCHAR(20)) - 'pending' or 'completed'
- `payment_date` (DATETIME)

#### 2. **delivery** table

- `delivery_id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)
- `order_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY â†’ orders.order_id)
- `delivery_method` (VARCHAR(50)) - 'store_pickup' or 'home_delivery'
- `address_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY â†’ address.address_id)
- `estimated_delivery_date` (DATE)
- `delivery_status` (VARCHAR(20)) - 'pending' by default

---

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Models Created

- **`backend/app/models/payment.py`** - Payment model with relationships
- **`backend/app/models/delivery.py`** - Delivery model with relationships
- Updated `Order` model to include payment and delivery relationships
- Updated `Address` model to include deliveries relationship
- Updated `backend/app/models/__init__.py` to import Payment and Delivery

### 2. Schemas Created

- **`backend/app/schemas/payment.py`** - PaymentCreate, PaymentOut
- **`backend/app/schemas/delivery.py`** - DeliveryCreate, DeliveryOut
- Updated **`backend/app/schemas/order.py`** - Added payment_method, delivery_method, and address_id to CreateOrderRequest

### 3. Routes Updated

- **`backend/app/routes/order.py`** - Updated `/orders/checkout` endpoint to:
  - Accept payment_method, delivery_method, and address_id
  - Create payment record with status based on payment method:
    - **Card payment** â†’ status = 'completed'
    - **Cash on Delivery** â†’ status = 'pending'
  - Create delivery record with estimated delivery date:
    - **Home delivery** â†’ 7 days estimated
    - **Store pickup** â†’ 2 days estimated
  - Validate that address_id is provided for home delivery

## Frontend Implementation

### Updated Checkout Page (`frontend/src/pages/Checkout.jsx`)

#### New Form Fields:

1. **Delivery Method Selection:**

   - âœ… Home Delivery (5-7 business days)
   - âœ… Store Pickup (2 business days)

2. **Payment Method Selection:**
   - âœ… Credit/Debit Card (Payment processed immediately)
   - âœ… Cash on Delivery (Pay on delivery, status pending)

#### Features:

## How It Works

### When Customer Places an Order:

1. **Customer fills out checkout form:**

   - Selects delivery method (Home Delivery or Store Pickup)
   - Selects payment method (Card or Cash on Delivery)

2. **Frontend sends request to `/orders/checkout` with:**

   ```json
   {
     "user_id": 1,
     "payment_method": "card" | "cod",
     "delivery_method": "home_delivery" | "store_pickup",
     "address_id": 123 (required for home_delivery)
   }
   ```

3. **Backend processes:**

   - Creates Order record
   - Creates OrderItem records from cart
   - **Creates Payment record:**
     - If payment_method = 'card' â†’ payment_status = 'completed'
     - If payment_method = 'cod' â†’ payment_status = 'pending'
   - **Creates Delivery record:**
     - Calculates estimated_delivery_date
     - Sets delivery_status = 'pending'
     - Stores address_id (if home delivery)
   - Clears cart items

4. **Customer sees success message with:**
   - Order ID
   - Total amount
   - Payment method and status
   - Delivery method

## Testing the Implementation

### Steps to Test:

1. **Start the backend server** (should already be running on http://127.0.0.1:8020)

2. **Start the frontend** (should be running on http://localhost:3000)

3. **Login to your account**

4. **Add items to cart** from the Shop page

5. **Go to Checkout page**

6. **Select Delivery Method:**

   - Choose "Home Delivery" or "Store Pickup"

7. **Select Payment Method:**

   - Choose "Credit/Debit Card" or "Cash on Delivery"

8. **Click "Place Order"**

9. **Check the database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY order_id DESC LIMIT 1;
   SELECT * FROM order_item WHERE order_id = <latest_order_id>;
   SELECT * FROM payment WHERE order_id = <latest_order_id>;
   SELECT * FROM delivery WHERE order_id = <latest_order_id>;
   ```

## Expected Results in Database

### Example: Home Delivery with Card Payment

**payment table:**

- payment_method: 'card'
- payment_status: 'completed'
- payment_date: Current timestamp

**delivery table:**

- delivery_method: 'home_delivery'
- address_id: User's address ID
- estimated_delivery_date: Current date + 7 days
- delivery_status: 'pending'

### Example: Store Pickup with Cash on Delivery

**payment table:**

- payment_method: 'cod'
- payment_status: 'pending'
- payment_date: Current timestamp

**delivery table:**

- delivery_method: 'store_pickup'
- address_id: NULL
- estimated_delivery_date: Current date + 2 days
- delivery_status: 'pending'
