## Normalization Analysis by Normal Form

### ‚úÖ First Normal Form (1NF) - ACHIEVED

**Requirements:**

- Each table has a primary key
- All columns contain atomic (indivisible) values
- No repeating groups

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Fully Compliant**

**Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ Every table has a clearly defined primary key (e.g., `user_id`, `product_id`, `order_id`)
- ‚úÖ All attributes contain atomic values (no arrays or lists stored in single columns)
- ‚úÖ No repeating columns (e.g., no `address1`, `address2`, `address3`)
- ‚úÖ Each row is uniquely identifiable

**Example:**

```sql
-- Good 1NF design: Separate cart_item table instead of storing items as array
cart_item (cart_item_id, cart_id, variant_id, quantity)
-- Not: cart (cart_id, items_array)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Second Normal Form (2NF) - ACHIEVED

**Requirements:**

- Must be in 1NF
- No partial dependencies (all non-key attributes must depend on the entire primary key)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Fully Compliant**

**Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ All tables with composite keys have proper dependencies
- ‚úÖ No attribute depends on only part of a composite key
- ‚úÖ Junction tables properly separate many-to-many relationships

**Example:**

```sql
-- order_item table: Both variant_id and order_id needed to determine quantity/price
order_item (
    order_item_id PRIMARY KEY,  -- Surrogate key eliminates partial dependency issues
    order_id,
    variant_id,
    quantity,  -- Depends on entire record (order + variant)
    price      -- Depends on entire record (order + variant)
)
```

**Proper Separation:**

- `cart_item` separates cart-variant relationships
- `order_item` separates order-variant relationships
- `variant_attribute_value` separates variant-attribute relationships
- `favorite_product` separates user-product favorites

---

### ‚úÖ Third Normal Form (3NF) - ACHIEVED

**Requirements:**

- Must be in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Mostly Compliant** (with minor denormalization for performance)

**Evidence:**

#### ‚úÖ Strong 3NF Implementation:

1. **Address Normalization**

   ```sql
   address (address_id, city_id, house_number, street, city, state)
   location (city_id, city, zip_code, is_main_city)
   ```

   - Address references location by `city_id` (foreign key)
   - City details stored once in `location` table
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** `city` and `state` appear in both `address` and `location` tables (denormalization - see below)

2. **Product-Category Separation**

   ```sql
   product (product_id, product_name, category_id, description)
   category (category_id, category_name, parent_category_id)
   ```

   - Product doesn't store category details, only `category_id`
   - Category information centralized in `category` table
   - Supports hierarchical categories (parent_category_id)

3. **Order-Payment Separation**

   ```sql
   orders (order_id, cart_id, user_id, order_date, total_amount)
   payment (payment_id, order_id, payment_method, payment_status, payment_date)
   ```

   - Payment details separated from order details
   - One-to-one relationship properly maintained
   - Payment status independent of order status

4. **Variant-Product Separation**
   ```sql
   product (product_id, product_name, category_id, description)
   variant (variant_id, variant_name, product_id, price, quantity, SKU)
   variant_attribute (attribute_id, attribute_name)
   variant_attribute_value (id, variant_id, attribute_id, value)
   ```
   - Product contains generic info
   - Variant contains specific SKU details (price, quantity)
   - Attributes (color, size) properly normalized via bridge table

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Intentional Denormalization (Acceptable):

1. **Address Table - City/State Duplication**

   ```sql
   address (address_id, city_id, house_number, street, city, state)
   ```

   - **Issue:** `city` and `state` stored in both `address` and `location`
   - **Why Acceptable:**
     - Improves query performance (no join needed for display)
     - Addresses might have custom city names (e.g., "Downtown Chicago" vs "Chicago")
     - Historical preservation if location data changes
   - **Impact:** Minimal redundancy, significant performance gain

2. **Order Amount Storage**

   ```sql
   orders (order_id, ..., total_amount)
   cart (cart_id, ..., total_amount)
   ```

   - **Issue:** `total_amount` can be calculated from order_items/cart_items
   - **Why Acceptable:**
     - Historical accuracy (price at time of order)
     - Performance (no need to sum items repeatedly)
     - Standard e-commerce practice
   - **Impact:** Essential for order history integrity

3. **Order Item Price**
   ```sql
   order_item (order_item_id, order_id, variant_id, quantity, price)
   ```
   - **Issue:** `price` duplicates data from `variant.price`
   - **Why Acceptable:**
     - Captures price at time of purchase
     - Variant prices may change over time
     - Critical for order history accuracy
   - **Impact:** Required for business logic

---

### ‚úÖ Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) - MOSTLY ACHIEVED

**Requirements:**

- Must be in 3NF
- Every determinant must be a candidate key

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Mostly Compliant**

**Evidence:**

- ‚úÖ Most tables have simple primary keys as sole determinants
- ‚úÖ No anomalous functional dependencies
- ‚úÖ Proper use of surrogate keys eliminates complex dependencies

**Example:**

```sql
-- category table supports BCNF with self-referencing hierarchy
category (
    category_id PRIMARY KEY,      -- Candidate key
    category_name,                -- Determined by category_id
    parent_category_id            -- Determined by category_id
)
```

**Potential BCNF Concern (Minor):**

- `variant_attribute_value` could theoretically have multiple determinants, but the use of a surrogate key (`id`) as primary key resolves this cleanly

---

## Data Integrity Features

### ‚úÖ Foreign Key Constraints

Your database makes excellent use of foreign keys with appropriate cascade rules:

1. **CASCADE DELETE (Appropriate):**

   ```sql
   - cart ‚Üí user (ON DELETE CASCADE)
   - cart_item ‚Üí cart (ON DELETE CASCADE)
   - delivery ‚Üí orders (ON DELETE CASCADE)
   - order_item ‚Üí orders (ON DELETE CASCADE)
   - payment ‚Üí orders (ON DELETE CASCADE)
   - variant ‚Üí product (ON DELETE CASCADE)
   - favorite_product ‚Üí user/product (ON DELETE CASCADE)
   ```

   ‚úÖ **Correct:** When parent is deleted, child records should also be deleted

2. **SET NULL (Appropriate):**

   ```sql
   - address ‚Üí location (ON DELETE SET NULL)
   - cart_item ‚Üí variant (ON DELETE SET NULL)
   - order_item ‚Üí variant (ON DELETE SET NULL)
   - user ‚Üí address (ON DELETE SET NULL)
   ```

   ‚úÖ **Correct:** Preserves historical data when referenced entity is deleted

3. **RESTRICT (Appropriate):**
   ```sql
   - orders ‚Üí cart (ON DELETE RESTRICT)
   - orders ‚Üí user (ON DELETE RESTRICT)
   ```
   ‚úÖ **Correct:** Prevents deletion of critical entities with dependencies

### ‚úÖ Unique Constraints

```sql
-- Prevents duplicate favorites
favorite_product: UNIQUE KEY unique_user_product (user_id, product_id)
```

‚úÖ **Excellent:** Ensures business logic integrity at database level

### ‚úÖ Indexes

```sql
-- favorite_product optimized with indexes
INDEX idx_user_id (user_id)
INDEX idx_product_id (product_id)
```

‚úÖ **Good:** Indexes on foreign keys improve join performance

## Relationship Analysis

### ‚úÖ One-to-One Relationships

1. **Order ‚Üí Payment** (1:1)

   - Each order has exactly one payment record
   - Properly separated for 3NF compliance

2. **Order ‚Üí Card** (1:1 optional)
   - Card details only exist for card payments
   - Properly separated for security and normalization

### ‚úÖ One-to-Many Relationships

1. **User ‚Üí Orders** (1:N)
2. **User ‚Üí Carts** (1:N)
3. **User ‚Üí Favorite_Products** (1:N)
4. **Product ‚Üí Variants** (1:N)
5. **Category ‚Üí Products** (1:N)
6. **Category ‚Üí Subcategories** (1:N - self-referencing)
7. **Cart ‚Üí Cart_Items** (1:N)
8. **Order ‚Üí Order_Items** (1:N)
9. **Location ‚Üí Addresses** (1:N)

### ‚úÖ Many-to-Many Relationships (with Junction Tables)

1. **Users ‚Üî Products** (via `favorite_product`)

   - Junction table: `favorite_product (favorite_id, user_id, product_id)`
   - ‚úÖ Properly normalized

2. **Variants ‚Üî Attributes** (via `variant_attribute_value`)
   - Junction table: `variant_attribute_value (id, variant_id, attribute_id, value)`
   - ‚úÖ Properly normalized with additional value field

## Design Strengths

### üåü Excellent Practices

1. **Surrogate Keys**

   - Every table uses auto-increment integer primary keys
   - Improves join performance and simplifies relationships
   - Example: `user_id`, `product_id`, `order_id`

2. **Hierarchical Data Handling**

   ```sql
   category (category_id, category_name, parent_category_id)
   ```

   - Self-referencing foreign key for category hierarchy
   - Allows unlimited depth of categories
   - Clean and normalized approach

3. **Temporal Data**

   ```sql
   orders (order_date DATETIME)
   payment (payment_date DATETIME)
   cart (created_date DATETIME)
   favorite_product (created_at DATETIME)
   ```

   - Proper timestamp tracking
   - Enables analytics and reporting

4. **Price History Preservation**

   ```sql
   order_item (price DECIMAL(10,2))
   ```

   - Stores price at time of purchase
   - Prevents data corruption when variant prices change
   - Essential for accurate order history

5. **Soft Delete Ready**

   - Foreign keys with `SET NULL` allow soft deletion patterns
   - Preserves referential integrity while maintaining history

6. **Security-Conscious Design**

   ```sql
   user (password_hash VARCHAR(100))  -- Not plaintext password
   card ‚Üí orders (separate table for sensitive card data)
   ```

7. **E-commerce Best Practices**
   - Separate cart and order systems
   - Variant-based inventory (color, size, etc.)
   - Multiple payment method support
   - Delivery tracking separation

## Minor Recommendations

### üîÑ Potential Improvements (Optional)

1. **Address Table - Remove Redundancy**

   ```sql
   -- Current (has redundancy)
   address (address_id, city_id, house_number, street, city, state)

   -- Fully normalized option (if performance isn't an issue)
   address (address_id, city_id, house_number, street)
   -- Get city and state from location table via join
   ```

   **Trade-off:** Better normalization vs. Query performance
   **Recommendation:** Keep current design for performance, it's acceptable denormalization

2. **Add Soft Delete Flags** (Optional)

   ```sql
   -- For audit trails and data recovery
   ALTER TABLE product ADD COLUMN is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
   ALTER TABLE variant ADD COLUMN is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
   ALTER TABLE user ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
   ```

   **Benefit:** Allows "undo" functionality, maintains data history

3. **Add Composite Indexes** (Performance)

   ```sql
   -- For frequently joined tables
   CREATE INDEX idx_cart_user ON cart(user_id, created_date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_order_user_date ON orders(user_id, order_date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_variant_product ON variant(product_id, variant_id);
   ```

   **Benefit:** Faster query performance for common operations

4. **Email Uniqueness Constraint**

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user ADD UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email (email);
   ```

   **Benefit:** Prevents duplicate user registrations at database level

5. **Product Availability View** (Convenience)
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW available_products AS
   SELECT p.*, SUM(v.quantity) as total_stock
   FROM product p
   LEFT JOIN variant v ON p.product_id = v.product_id
   GROUP BY p.product_id
   HAVING total_stock > 0;
   ```
   **Benefit:** Easy queries for in-stock products
