# Delivery Time Logic Implementation

## ✅ Updates Complete!

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Removed Tax from Checkout**

- ❌ Removed 10% tax calculation
- ✅ Total now equals Subtotal (no tax added)
- Frontend displays: Subtotal + Free Shipping = Total

#### 2. **Smart Delivery Time Calculation**

The estimated delivery time is now calculated based on:

1. **Stock Availability** - Checks if all items in the order are in stock
2. **Destination City** - Checks if the delivery address is in a main city

### Delivery Time Logic:

```
For Home Delivery:
├── Main Cities (Is_main_city = TRUE)
│   ├── In Stock: 5 days
│   └── Out of Stock: 8 days (5 + 3)
│
└── Other Cities (Is_main_city = FALSE)
    ├── In Stock: 7 days
    └── Out of Stock: 10 days (7 + 3)

For Store Pickup:
└── Always: 2 days
```

### How It Works:

1. **Stock Check:**

   - System checks each item in the cart
   - Compares `cart_item.quantity` with `variant.quantity`
   - If ANY item has insufficient stock → Out of Stock

2. **City Type Check:**

   - Gets `address_id` from the order request
   - Finds `city_id` from the `address` table
   - Checks `location` table for `Is_main_city` flag
   - If `Is_main_city = TRUE` → Main City (5 days base)
   - If `Is_main_city = FALSE` → Other City (7 days base)

3. **Final Calculation:**
   ```python
   base_days = 5 if is_main_city else 7
   if not all_in_stock:
       base_days += 3
   estimated_delivery_date = current_date + base_days
   ```

### Backend Changes:

**File: `backend/app/routes/order.py`**

- Added imports: `Address`, `Location`
- Updated delivery calculation logic:
  - Check stock availability for all cart items
  - Query address and location tables to determine city type
  - Calculate delivery days based on stock and city
  - Store `estimated_delivery_date` in delivery table

### Frontend Changes:

**File: `frontend/src/pages/Checkout.jsx`**

- ❌ Removed tax line: `Tax (10%): $XX.XX`
- ❌ Removed tax from total calculation
- ✅ Updated delivery method descriptions:
  - Home Delivery: Shows "Main cities: 5 days (8 days if out of stock)" and "Other cities: 7 days (10 days if out of stock)"
  - Store Pickup: Still 2 days
- ✅ Updated info alert to mention stock availability and city

### Database Tables Used:

1. **variant** - `quantity` field to check stock
2. **address** - `city_id` field to link to location
3. **location** - `Is_main_city` boolean field
4. **delivery** - `estimated_delivery_date` stores calculated date

### Example Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Main City + In Stock**

- Customer in Colombo (main city)
- All items in stock (variant.quantity >= order quantity)
- Result: **5 days delivery**

**Scenario 2: Main City + Out of Stock**

- Customer in Colombo (main city)
- One or more items out of stock
- Result: **8 days delivery** (5 + 3)

**Scenario 3: Other City + In Stock**

- Customer in Matara (not main city)
- All items in stock
- Result: **7 days delivery**

**Scenario 4: Other City + Out of Stock**

- Customer in Matara (not main city)
- One or more items out of stock
- Result: **10 days delivery** (7 + 3)

**Scenario 5: Store Pickup**

- Any city
- Any stock status
- Result: **2 days** (always)

### Testing:

1. **Ensure location table has correct data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM location;
   -- Should have Is_main_city set to TRUE for main cities
   ```

2. **Ensure address has city_id:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM address;
   -- city_id should match location.city_id
   ```

3. **Test different scenarios:**
   - Place order with items in stock to main city → Should show 5 days
   - Place order with items in stock to other city → Should show 7 days
   - Reduce variant.quantity to 0 for test → Out of stock orders should add 3 days
   - Store pickup → Always 2 days

### Status: ✅ READY TO TEST
